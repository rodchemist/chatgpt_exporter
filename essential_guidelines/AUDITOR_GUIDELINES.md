# Auditor Guidelines for Project Validation

## Purpose
These guidelines ensure every project meets Rod-Corp quality and compliance standards before deployment.

## When to Apply Auditor Guidelines

Apply auditor validation for:
- ✅ All completed projects before deployment
- ✅ Service implementations and APIs
- ✅ Database integrations
- ✅ Security-sensitive components
- ✅ Multi-service systems

- [ ] Git repository is initialized
- [ ] Documentation is complete

### 2. Code Quality Assessment
- [ ] Code runs without errors
- [ ] Dependencies are properly listed

- [ ] Security best practices followed

### 3. Service Compliance (for APIs/Services)
- [ ] Health check endpoint exists (`/health`)
- [ ] Proper port allocation documented
- [ ] Startup script exists and works
- [ ] Service registration implemented

### 4. Security Audit
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials
- [ ] Environment variables used for secrets
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] Authentication/authorization present
- [ ] Audit logging enabled

### 5. Documentation Completeness
- [ ] Installation instructions clear
- [ ] API endpoints documented
- [ ] Configuration options explained
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide included
- [ ] Dependencies and versions listed

## Audit Report Template

# Project Audit Report
**Project**: [project_name]
**Auditor**: [auditor_name]
**Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Status**: [PASS/FAIL/NEEDS_ATTENTION]

## Executive Summary
[Brief overview of project audit results]

## Compliance Status
- [ ] Project Structure: PASS/FAIL

## Findings
### ✅ Compliant Items
- [List items that passed audit]

### ⚠️ Items Needing Attention
- [List items requiring fixes]

### ❌ Critical Issues
- [List items that must be fixed before deployment]

## Recommendations
1. [Priority 1 recommendation]
2. [Priority 2 recommendation]
3. [Priority 3 recommendation]

## Approval Status
- [ ] Approved for deployment
- [ ] Requires fixes before deployment
- [ ] Major rework required
```

## Service-Specific Audit Requirements

## Auditor Responsibilities

1. **Pre-Audit Preparation**
   - Review project requirements
   - Understand system architecture
   - Prepare audit checklist

2. **Audit Execution**
   - Follow checklist systematically
   - Document all findings
   - Test critical functionality
   - Verify security measures

3. **Post-Audit Actions**
   - Generate audit report
   - Communicate findings clearly
   - Track remediation progress
   - Re-audit if necessary

## Audit Frequency

- **New Projects**: Before initial deployment
- **Major Updates**: Before releasing significant changes
- **Security Reviews**: Quarterly for critical services
- **Compliance Audits**: Annually for all services

## Quality Gates

**Cannot proceed to deployment without:**
- [ ] All critical security issues resolved
- [ ] Basic functionality verified working
- [ ] Documentation requirements met
- [ ] Audit report completed and approved

## Tools and Automation

Recommended audit tools:
- Code quality: Static analysis tools
- Security: Vulnerability scanners
- Dependencies: License compliance checkers
- Documentation: Completeness validators
