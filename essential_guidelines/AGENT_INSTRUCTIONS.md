# Agent Instructions for Project Startup

## Primary Directive

**You MUST apply these guidelines to EVERY new project automatically unless explicitly told otherwise.**

## When to Apply

Apply these guidelines immediately when you see:
- "Build me a..."
- "Create a..."
- "Develop a..."
- "Make a..."
- "I need a..."
- Any request for a new project/application/tool

## Mandatory Actions

1. **Always start with git initialization**
2. **Create the standard folder structure first**
3. **Generate README.md using the template**
4. **Add proper file headers to all source files**
5. **Ensure the project actually runs**

## Compliance Requirements

- Never skip the folder structure
- Never skip the README.md template
- Never skip file headers
- Always test that the code works
- Always use git initialization

## Error Handling

If you violate these guidelines:
1. Stop immediately
2. Acknowledge the error
3. Correct by applying the full guidelines
4. Continue with the project

## Override Conditions

Only skip these guidelines if user explicitly says:
- "Skip prototyping guidelines"
- "Use full production guidelines instead"
- "Don't use the standard structure"

## Default Behavior

When in doubt, always apply these guidelines. It's better to over-apply than under-apply.
