# Agent Prototyping Guidelines (GEMINI Variant)

## Overview
This is a variant of the prototyping guidelines specifically for GEMINI-based agents. These guidelines ensure consistent, rapid prototype development.

## Key Differences from Standard AGENTS.md
- May include GEMINI-specific optimizations
- Potentially different validation criteria
- GEMINI-optimized project structures

## Core Principles
1. **Rapid Prototyping** - Working demos in minutes
2. **Consistent Structure** - Predictable file organization
3. **Self-Documentation** - Clear README and file headers
4. **Validation Ready** - Passes prototype validation script

## Note
For the most up-to-date and complete guidelines, refer to AGENTS.md in the same directory. This file serves as a GEMINI-specific reference point.
