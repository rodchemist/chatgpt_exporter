# Contribution Summary: ai_predicting_chocolate to ai_timeseries_framework (Updated)

## Overview
The `ai_predicting_chocolate` folder contains scripts and utilities for early experiments on predicting chocolate production metrics. It focuses on data extraction, preprocessing, and exploratory modeling.

## Key Contributions

1.  **Database Connectivity**: The `config/db_config.py` script provides functions to connect to various databases (MSSQL, MySQL, MongoDB) using SQLAlchemy and other libraries. This could be integrated into the framework's data ingestion modules.
2.  **Data Extraction and Preprocessing**: Scripts like `01_extract_data.py`, `11_SuperExtractor.py`, and `00_Random_code.py` demonstrate data extraction, cleaning, and export functionalities. These could enhance the framework's data preprocessing capabilities.
3.  **Correlation Analysis**: The `03_TU_correlations.py` script shows how to compute various types of correlations (Pearson, Spearman, Kendall, distance) between time series data. This is valuable for feature selection and understanding relationships in time series data.
4.  **Model Testing and Evaluation**: The `05_first_testing_nural.py` script provides a comprehensive example of testing and evaluating multiple models for time series forecasting, which aligns well with the framework's goals.

## Selected Scripts for Integration
1.  `05_first_testing_nural.py`: Demonstrates how to read data from a SQL database, prepare it for modeling, and test various machine learning models for time series forecasting. It also evaluates the models and saves the results to an Excel file.
2.  `03_TU_correlations.py`: Shows how to compute various types of correlations between time series data, which is valuable for feature selection.

## Integration Plan
1.  Adapt the selected scripts to align with the `ai_timeseries_framework`'s coding standards and directory structure.
2.  Integrate the adapted scripts into the framework's data preprocessing, model testing, and evaluation pipelines.
3.  Update the framework's documentation to include the new capabilities.
