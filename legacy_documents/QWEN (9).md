# Qwen Context Documentation - DATA_FILES Directory

## Overview
This directory contains data files for the Inciva project, which appears to be a system for tracking community activities, organizations, and vulnerability data in municipalities, likely in a Colombian department based on the data structure.

## Files

### inciva_base.sqlite
- **Type**: SQLite database
- **Purpose**: Main database for the Inciva project containing information about:
  - Community activities and interventions
  - Municipalities and population centers
  - Organizations and community actors
  - Vulnerability data for population centers
  - User information
  - Lookup tables for sectors, zones, themes, and other classifications

#### Key Database Tables:
- **frm_actividades**: Main activities table with details like date, description, and participant counts
- **geo_departamentos**: Department-level geographic information
- **geo_municipios**: Municipality-level geographic information
- **frm_organizaciones**: Community organizations
- **ref_centros_poblados**: Population centers data
- **ref_vulnerabilidad_centros**: Vulnerability indices for population centers
- **frm_detalles_actividad**: Detailed information about activities including themes and age groups
- **frm_adjuntos**: Attachments related to activities (photos, attendance lists)
- **frm_actores_comunitarios**: Community actors involved in activities
- **frm_intervenciones**: Types of interventions in activities

#### Key Database Views:
- Various analytical views for reporting on activities by municipality, date, participants, etc.
- Specialized views for recurrent activities, recent activities, and vulnerability assessments

### parallel_model_test_results.json
- **Type**: JSON test results file
- **Purpose**: Contains results from testing 97 different machine learning models
- **Key Information**:
  - All 97 models tested had a 0% success rate
  - Tests were run with 5 parallel workers
  - Total testing time was approximately 0.17 seconds
  - Models tested include various time series and forecasting libraries like Prophet, AutoFormer, Chronos, etc.
  - The test environment appears to be related to the Inciva project but none of the models were found/working

### test.txt
- **Type**: Empty text file
- **Purpose**: Placeholder or temporary file

## Project Context
The Inciva project appears to be a community engagement tracking system with a focus on:
1. Monitoring activities in municipalities
2. Tracking participation in community programs
3. Managing data about local organizations
4. Assessing vulnerability in population centers
5. Analyzing trends through various database views

The parallel model testing suggests there may have been an attempt to integrate machine learning models for data analysis or forecasting, but none of the models were successfully implemented or found in the current environment.
