## Key Files

### ARCHIVE_DOCUMENTATION.md
Main documentation file detailing the archive process, containing:
- Executive summary of the repository migration
- Archive structure and categorization
- Statistics on processed repositories
- Archive rationale and criteria
- Maintenance guidelines

### general_docs/repository_guidelines.md
Contains guidelines for consistent repositories under AI_Repos_Integration:
- Standardized directory structure
- Docker and local testing configurations
- Logging standards
- Frontend development approaches
- Security practices
- Git configuration guidelines

## Purpose
This archive serves as a preservation point for repositories and files that:
1. Have been superseded by newer versions (DUPLICATES)
2. Are no longer actively developed but may be referenced (INACTIVE)
3. Represent completed work that should be preserved (COMPLETED)

## Access Patterns
- This directory is intended for read-only access
- Git history is preserved for all archived repositories
- Restoration should use git clone if repositories need reactivation

## Maintenance
For future archival:
1. Evaluate repository for appropriate category (COMPLETED, DUPLICATES, INACTIVE)
2. Verify git integrity before moving
3. Update archive documentation
4. Remove from active development indices
5. Add to archive tracking systems
