# Guides Repository

This directory contains various guides and documentation for different aspects of the project ecosystem.

## Purpose

The `guides` directory is intended to house instructional documents, tutorials, and reference materials that help users understand and work with the various components of this repository collection.

## Structure

Guides should be organized by topic or technology:

```
guides/
├── ai-ml/
│   ├── machine-learning-setup.md
│   ├── data-preprocessing-guide.md
│   └── model-deployment.md
├── development/
│   ├── coding-standards.md
│   ├── git-workflow.md
│   └── testing-practices.md
├── infrastructure/
│   ├── deployment-guide.md
│   ├── monitoring.md
│   └── backup-procedures.md
└── ...
```

## Contributing

When adding new guides:
1. Place them in the appropriate subdirectory
2. Follow the existing naming conventions
3. Include a table of contents for longer documents
4. Use clear, actionable language
5. Provide examples where appropriate
