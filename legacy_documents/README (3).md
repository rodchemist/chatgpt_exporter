# ARCHIVES Directory

## Purpose
This directory serves as a staging area or placeholder for archived repositories and projects within the organized repository structure.

## Current Status
This directory is intentionally kept empty as part of the repository organization system. Archived repositories are stored in the main ARCHIVE directory with proper categorization.

## Directory Structure
Archived repositories are organized in the main ARCHIVE directory with the following structure:
```
../ARCHIVE/
├── COMPLETED/         # Final/completed project versions
├── DUPLICATES/        # Duplicate or superseded versions
├── INACTIVE/          # Dormant or testing repositories
└── ARCHIVE_DOCUMENTATION.md
```
