
This repository contains scripts and utilities for evaluating more than 30 state-of-the-art models across seven conda environments. It is primarily used for chocolate tempering prediction but can be adapted for other time series tasks.

The readme_comprehensive.md file provides a detailed overview of the available environments, models, and troubleshooting steps. Start there if you need full documentation.

Quick Usage

1. Install the required conda environments using enhanced_conda_installer.sh.

2. Run setup_test_environment.sh to prepare the test directories.

3. Execute quick_test.sh or run_all_tests.sh to benchmark the models.

Test results are written to the test_results/ directory.

Notes

Older troubleshooting scripts have been archived under the obs/ folder.
