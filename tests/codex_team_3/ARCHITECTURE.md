# System Architecture

## Overview
This system implements a comprehensive Universal Documentation System (UDS) framework with automated tracking, quality assurance, and continuous monitoring capabilities. The architecture provides a scalable solution for maintaining documentation across complex software projects.

## Installation
The system requires Python 3.8+ and can be installed using the provided requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python agents/scripts/documentation_engine.py --init
```

## Core Components

### Services
- **Documentation Engine**: Core service for scanning, generating, and tracking documentation
- **Quality Monitor**: Automated quality assessment and scoring system
- **Change Tracker**: Version control and change history management
- **Service Discovery**: Automatic detection of microservices and APIs

### Documentation System
- Automated scanning and generation
- Quality metrics tracking with threshold monitoring
- Change history management with audit trails
- Service discovery and automatic documentation
- Template-based document generation
- SQLite database for persistent tracking

## Technology Stack
- **Runtime**: Python 3.8+
- **Database**: SQLite for tracking and metrics
- **Documentation**: Markdown format with templates
- **Version Control**: Git integration
- **Monitoring**: Continuous scanning with configurable intervals
- **Quality**: Automated scoring with customizable thresholds

## Usage
The system provides several operational modes:

```bash
# Initialize the system
python agents/scripts/documentation_engine.py --init

# Scan for documentation needs
python agents/scripts/documentation_engine.py --scan

# Generate missing documentation
python agents/scripts/documentation_engine.py --generate

# Start continuous monitoring
python agents/scripts/documentation_engine.py --monitor

# Verify implementation completeness
python agents/scripts/documentation_engine.py --verify
```

## API Integration
The documentation engine exposes REST endpoints for integration:

```python
# Example API usage
GET /status - System health and metrics
POST /scan - Trigger documentation scan
POST /generate - Generate documentation
GET /metrics - Quality metrics and scores
```

## Data Flow
1. **Source Code Scanning**: Automated discovery of code files and services
2. **Documentation Generation**: Template-based creation of missing documentation
3. **Quality Assessment**: Scoring based on content analysis and completeness
4. **Storage and Tracking**: Persistent storage in SQLite database
5. **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time updates and quality maintenance

## License
This system is released under the MIT License, providing flexibility for both commercial and open-source usage.
