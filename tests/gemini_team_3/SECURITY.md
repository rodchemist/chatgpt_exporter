# Security Policy

## Overview
Security policy for the Universal Documentation System. This document outlines supported versions, vulnerability reporting procedures, and implemented security measures.

## Installation Security
Ensure secure installation practices:

```bash
# Use virtual environment to isolate dependencies
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Verify package integrity
pip install --require-hashes -r requirements.txt
```

## Supported Versions

Security updates are provided for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          | End of Life |
| ------- | ------------------ | ----------- |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: | TBD |
| < 1.0   | :x:                | Immediate |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Contact Information
Please report security vulnerabilities to: security@example.com

### Required Information
Include the following in your report:
- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed reproduction steps
- **Potential Impact**: Assessment of potential security impact
- **Affected Versions**: Which versions are affected
- **Suggested Fix**: Proposed solution (if available)

### Response Timeline
- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Development**: Within 2 weeks
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is available

## Security Measures

### Data Protection
- **Database Security**: SQLite database with restricted file permissions
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Path Traversal Protection**: File path validation prevents directory traversal
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries used throughout

### Usage Security
```python
# Example of secure usage
from agents.scripts.documentation_engine import DocumentationEngine

# Initialize with safe defaults
engine = DocumentationEngine()

# Validate inputs before processing
if not Path(user_input).resolve().is_relative_to(project_root):
    raise SecurityError("Invalid path")
```

### API Security
- **Authentication**: Required for write operations
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse of scanning endpoints
- **Input Sanitization**: All API inputs are validated
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages without information disclosure

### File System Security
```bash
# Secure file permissions
chmod 750 .documentation/
chmod 640 .documentation/tracking.db
chmod 644 .documentation/templates/*
```

### Monitoring and Logging
- **Activity Logging**: All operations are logged with timestamps
- **Error Tracking**: Security-relevant errors are specially flagged
- **Access Monitoring**: File access patterns are tracked

## Security Best Practices

### For Users
- Keep Python and dependencies updated
- Use virtual environments
- Restrict database file permissions
- Monitor activity logs regularly

### For Developers
- Follow secure coding practices
- Validate all inputs
- Use parameterized queries
- Implement proper error handling
