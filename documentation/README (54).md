# ISO 9001 Documentation Suite

This directory contains the controlled documentation required to operate the Rod-Corp ISO 9001:2015-aligned Quality Management System. All documents include metadata blocks and are tracked through the registers and change log in this folder.

## Contents
- Core QMS manual and policy documents (`RC-QMS-001` to `RC-QMS-009`).
- Change management artifacts (`CHANGE_LOG.md`, `DOCUMENT_REGISTER.csv`, `SCRIPT_REGISTER.csv`).
- Legacy mapping for historical references (`LEGACY_SOURCE_MAP.md`).
- Review scheduling (`REVIEW_CALENDAR.md`).

## Maintenance Rules
- Any modification must follow `DOCUMENT_CONTROL_PROCEDURE.md`.
- Registers are auto-generated; run the inventory scripts before committing major changes.
- Superseded documents move to `docs/archive/` with proper annotations.

For questions contact the Documentation Manager or quality@rod-corp.internal.
