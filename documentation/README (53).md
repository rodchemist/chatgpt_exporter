# Controlled Knowledge Base (Planned)

This directory will host curated guides, SOPs, work instructions, and reference materials that support Rod-Corp operations. Content is being migrated from the legacy repository according to `LEGACY_SOURCE_MAP.md`.

Until migration completes, refer to existing documents in the repository root and `docs/legacy/` for historical context.
