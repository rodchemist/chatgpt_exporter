# AI Image and Video Generation Toolkit

A comprehensive and professional toolkit for generating images and videos using a variety of AI models. This toolkit is designed to be easy to use and extend, and it provides a unified interface for working with different models.

## Features

*   **Multi-model support:** Generate images and videos using a variety of models, including Stable Diffusion, SDXL, FLUX, and SD3.
*   **Video generation:** Create video sequences from a series of prompts.
*   **Easy to use:** The toolkit is designed to be easy to use, with a simple and intuitive command-line interface.
*   **Extensible:** The toolkit is designed to be extensible, so you can easily add support for new models and features.
*   **Organized and professional structure:** The project is organized in a clean and professional way, making it easy to understand and maintain.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   NVIDIA RTX 4090 (or similar with 24GB+ VRAM)
*   Miniconda/Anaconda installed
*   CUDA 12.1+ drivers

### Installation

1.  **Create a conda environment:**

    ```bash
    mamba create -n image_gen python=3.11
    mamba activate image_gen
    ```

2.  **Install the dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To use the toolkit, you can run the `main.py` script. This script provides a command-line interface for generating images and videos.

```bash
python main.py --help
```

### Image Generation

To generate an image, you can use the `generate image` command. This command takes a prompt as input and generates an image based on that prompt.

```bash
python main.py generate image "A beautiful landscape with a river and mountains in the background."
```

### Video Generation

To generate a video, you can use the `generate video` command. This command takes a series of prompts as input and generates a video based on those prompts.

```bash
python main.py generate video "A person walking down the street." "The person turns a corner." "The person sees a dog."
```

## Configuration

The toolkit can be configured using the `config.yaml` file. This file allows you to specify the models you want to use, the output directory, and other settings.
