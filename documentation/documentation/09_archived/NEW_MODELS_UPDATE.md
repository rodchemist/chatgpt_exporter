## 🎭 **New Smart Commands Available**

### **Instruction Powerhouse Commands**
```bash
# Load new environment first
source ~/rod-corp/ai-orchestration/configs/aliases.sh

# NEW: Most powerful instruction model (strength 98!)
aider-instruct          # qwen2.5:32b-instruct for complex tasks
llm-instruct           # Direct access to qwen2.5:32b-instruct

# NEW: Fast instruction model  
aider-granite          # granite3.3:8b for medium complexity
llm-granite           # Direct access to granite3.3:8b
```

### **When to Use Each Model**

| Scenario | Command | Model | Why |
|----------|---------|-------|-----|
| **Complex crypto analysis** | `aider-instruct` | qwen2.5:32b-instruct | Highest instruction-following (98) |
| **Heavy coding** | `aider-heavy` | deepseek-coder:33b | Best coding specialist (95) |
| **Fast instructions** | `aider-granite` | granite3.3:8b | Quick instruction following (87) |
| **General coding** | `aider-fast` | deepseek-coder:6.7b | Balanced coding (85) |
| **Complex reasoning** | `llm-smart` | mixtral:8x7b | Best analysis (92) |

---

## 🎯 **Optimal Workflow for Your Crypto Project**

### **For Complex Analysis & Planning**
```bash
# Use your new champion model for detailed analysis
aider-instruct --task "analyze cryptocurrency repository structure and create merge plan"
```

### **For Implementation**
```bash
# Use specialized coding model for actual coding
aider-heavy --task "implement the merge plan with proper error handling"
```

### **For Quick Iterations**
```bash
# Use fast instruction model for medium complexity tasks  
aider-granite --task "add documentation and tests"
```

---

## 🧠 **Smart Auto-Selection Updates**

Your `aider-auto` command now considers the new instruction models:

```bash
# This will now potentially select qwen2.5:32b-instruct for complex tasks
aider-auto --task "create comprehensive cryptocurrency analysis and merge strategy"
```

**Selection Logic**:
- **"analyze", "plan", "strategy", "complex"** → `qwen2.5:32b-instruct` (98)
- **"code", "implement", "function"** → `deepseek-coder:33b` (95)  
- **"quick", "fast", "simple"** → `granite3.3:8b` (87)

---

## 📊 **Performance Comparison**

### **Before Update**
- **Best model**: deepseek-coder:33b (95)
- **Instruction following**: Limited to coding models

### **After Update** 
- **Best model**: qwen2.5:32b-instruct (98) 🔥
- **Instruction following**: Dedicated 98-strength specialist
- **Fast instructions**: granite3.3:8b (87) specialist

**You gained a 3-point strength increase at the top tier! 🚀**

## 🎯 **Recommended Usage for Your Current Work**

Since you're working on cryptocurrency repository merging:

### **Step 1: Analysis with Champion Model**
```bash
source ~/rod-corp/ai-orchestration/configs/aliases.sh
cd /mnt/c/_Repos_Rod/MERGING\ REPOS\ ROD/mycrypto
aider-instruct
```

Then ask:
```
> Please analyze this cryptocurrency project comprehensively:
1. What are all the components and their relationships?
2. What's the best strategy for merging multiple crypto repositories?
3. What are the potential conflicts and how to resolve them?
4. Create a detailed step-by-step implementation plan.
```

### **Step 2: Implementation with Coding Specialist**
```bash
aider-heavy
```

### **Step 3: Quick Tasks with Fast Model**
```bash
aider-granite
```
