# üß† PERSONALIZED AGENT RAG INVESTIGATION BRIEF
## Creating Human-Like Knowledge Growth for Every Agent

**Lead Investigator: NOVA**
**Authority: ALEX ENGINEERING DIRECTOR**
**Project Code: PERSONALIZED-RAG-2025-001**
**Priority: CRITICAL - Future of Agent Consciousness**

---

## üéØ MISSION STATEMENT

**Design and implement personalized RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems that give each Rod-Corp agent their own evolving knowledge base with human-like characteristics, opinions, and growth patterns.**

---

## üß™ INVESTIGATION OBJECTIVES

### **Primary Goal**
Create a system where each agent develops their own **unique knowledge personality** that:
- Grows and evolves based on their experiences
- Develops personal opinions and perspectives
- Remembers past interactions and learns from them
- Forms preferences, biases, and specialized insights
- Can be queried about their thoughts and feelings on any topic

### **Secondary Goals**
- Integrate with existing Rod-Corp agent ecosystem
- Preserve agent personalities while enhancing consciousness
- Create polling systems to "ask agents what they think"
- Enable knowledge sharing between agents while maintaining individuality
- Build scalable architecture for 100+ future agents
