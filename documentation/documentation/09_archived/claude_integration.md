# Advanced RAG System Integration with Claude

## Overview

This document explains how to integrate the Advanced RAG System with Claude Code to leverage Retrieval-Augmented Generation capabilities for domain-specific queries.

## Integration Points

### 1. Claude Code Commands

The RAG system provides several Claude Code commands for interacting with domain-specific agents:

```
/rag-query --domain <domain> --question "<question>"
/rag-status
/rag-evaluate --test-file <file>
```

### 2. Direct API Access

Claude can directly access the RAG system through its API endpoints:

- `POST /query` - Submit a query to the RAG system
- `GET /status` - Get system status and agent information
- `POST /evaluate` - Evaluate system performance

### 3. Context Integration

The RAG system can provide contextual information to Claude through:

1. **Retrieved Documents** - Relevant documents retrieved for a query
2. **Domain Classification** - Identification of the appropriate domain expert
3. **Confidence Scores** - Self-assessment of answer quality
4. **Citations** - Source references for retrieved information

## Implementation Examples

### Example 1: Food QA Query

```
User: "What are the health benefits of eating quinoa?"

Claude Code Command:
/rag-query --domain food_qa --question "What are the health benefits of eating quinoa?"

RAG System Response:
{
  "query": "What are the health benefits of eating quinoa?",
  "answer": "Quinoa is a highly nutritious grain with several health benefits...",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "domain": "food_qa",
  "agent": "Food QA Expert",
  "retrieved_docs": [...]
}

Claude Response to User:
"Based on nutritional research, quinoa offers several health benefits..."
```

### Example 2: Time-Series Forecasting

```
User: "How can I forecast sales data using machine learning?"

Claude Code Command:
/rag-query --domain time_series_ml --question "How can I forecast sales data using machine learning?"

RAG System Response:
{
  "query": "How can I forecast sales data using machine learning?",
  "answer": "For sales forecasting, you can use several ML approaches...",
  "confidence": 0.82,
  "domain": "time_series_ml",
  "agent": "Time-Series ML Expert",
  "retrieved_docs": [...]
}

Claude Response to User:
"To forecast sales data using machine learning, you can follow these steps..."
```

## Best Practices for Claude Integration

### 1. Domain Routing

Use the domain classification feature to route queries to the appropriate expert:

```
# Check domain before querying
domain = classify_query_domain(query)
rag_query(domain, query)
```

### 2. Confidence Thresholds

Respect confidence thresholds when using RAG responses:

```
if confidence > 0.8:
    # Use RAG response directly
    answer = rag_response
elif confidence > 0.6:
    # Augment with additional context
    answer = "Based on my knowledge and some research: " + rag_response
else:
    # Fall back to general knowledge
    answer = "I'm not certain about this, but here's what I know..."
```

### 3. Context Enhancement

Enhance Claude's context with RAG-retrieved information:

```
# Provide retrieved documents as context
context = "\n".join([doc['content'] for doc in retrieved_docs[:3]])
claude_prompt = f"Based on the following information:\n{context}\n\nAnswer: {query}"
```

## Advanced Features

### 1. Self-Grading and Critique

The RAG system includes self-grading capabilities:

```
confidence, feedback = rag_system.self_grade(query, answer, docs)
if confidence < 0.7:
    # Request re-retrieval or human intervention
    rag_system.requery(query)
```

### 2. Multi-Agent Collaboration

Different domain experts can collaborate on complex queries:

```
# For interdisciplinary queries
food_expert_answer = rag_query("food_qa", "nutritional aspects of quinoa")
legal_expert_answer = rag_query("legal_compliance", "food labeling requirements for quinoa")
combined_answer = combine_expert_answers([food_expert_answer, legal_expert_answer])
```

### 3. Continuous Learning

The system supports adding new knowledge:

```
# Add new research findings
rag_system.add_knowledge("food_qa", new_nutrition_studies)
```

## Performance Considerations

### 1. Latency Optimization

- Use caching for frequently asked questions
- Implement query preprocessing for better retrieval
- Use lightweight models for initial classification

### 2. Quality Assurance

- Regular evaluation of retrieval and answer quality
- Monitoring of confidence scores and user feedback
- A/B testing of different retrieval strategies

### 3. Scalability

- Horizontal scaling of retriever components
- Load balancing across domain experts
- Database sharding for large knowledge bases

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Low Confidence Scores** - Check if knowledge base has sufficient information
2. **Wrong Domain Routing** - Review domain classification logic
3. **Slow Response Times** - Optimize vector database queries

### Debugging Commands

```
/rag-status          # Check system health
/rag-debug-query     # Get detailed retrieval information
/rag-clear-cache     # Clear query cache
```

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Agentic RAG

Implement planning and tool selection capabilities:

```
# Multi-step reasoning
plan = planner.create_plan(query)
for step in plan:
    result = rag_query(step.domain, step.question)
    context += result.answer
```

### 2. Multimodal RAG

Support for images, charts, and other modalities:

```
# Handle multimodal queries
if query.contains_image():
    rag_query_multimodal("image_retrieval", query)
```

### 3. Graph RAG

Use knowledge graphs for complex reasoning:

```
# Multi-hop reasoning
subgraph = kg_retrieve(query)
answer = rag_query("kg_expert", subgraph)
```

This integration enables Claude to leverage specialized domain knowledge while maintaining its conversational abilities and general intelligence.
