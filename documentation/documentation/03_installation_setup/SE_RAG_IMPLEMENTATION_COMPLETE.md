    methodology_result = await self._methodology_improvement_phase()

    # 3. Self-evaluate and adapt
    evaluation_result = await self._self_evaluation_phase()

    # 4. Synthesize and integrate knowledge
    integration_result = await self._knowledge_integration_phase()

    # 5. Plan next research areas
    planning_result = await self._research_planning_phase()

    # 6. Enhance RAG capabilities
    rag_enhancement_result = await self._rag_enhancement_phase()
```
