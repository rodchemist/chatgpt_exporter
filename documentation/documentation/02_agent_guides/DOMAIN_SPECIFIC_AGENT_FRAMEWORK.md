# Rod-Corp Domain-Specific Agent Framework
## Standards and Guidelines for Specialized AI Agents

### 🎯 Overview

This framework provides comprehensive standards for defining, implementing, and managing domain-specific specialized agents within the Rod-Corp ecosystem. Based on industry best practices from Microsoft Azure AI, CrewAI, LangGraph, and academic research from 2024-2025.

## 📋 Domain Specialization Standards

## 🏗️ Agent Specialization Architecture

### Microsoft Azure AI Orchestration Patterns (Applied to Rod-Corp)

**1. Sequential Orchestration Pattern**
```python
# Example: Document Processing Pipeline
ALEX_Technical_Analysis → DATA_PROCESSING → DATA_QUALITY → CORPORATE
```

**2. Concurrent Orchestration Pattern**
```python
# Example: Multi-perspective Analysis
Input → [PHOENIX, RAVEN, ZARA] → HARMONY (Synthesis)
```

**3. Hierarchical Orchestration Pattern**
```python
# Example: Project Management
MAYA_PM_SUBDIRECTOR → [ATLAS, NOVA, SOPHIA] → [Individual Contributors]
```

- **Avoiding over-specialization**: Maintain enough flexibility for system evolution

### 2. Technology Stack Alignment
- **Domain-appropriate tools**: Match technologies to domain requirements
- **Integration standards**: Consistent APIs and communication protocols
- **Version management**: Coordinated technology updates across domain

### 3. Knowledge Management
- **Domain expertise documentation**: Comprehensive knowledge bases
- **Best practices sharing**: Cross-domain learning mechanisms
- **Continuous learning**: Regular updates from external sources

### 4. Performance Optimization
- **Domain-specific metrics**: Relevant KPIs for each specialization
- **Benchmarking**: Regular comparison with industry standards
- **Continuous improvement**: Iterative capability enhancement
