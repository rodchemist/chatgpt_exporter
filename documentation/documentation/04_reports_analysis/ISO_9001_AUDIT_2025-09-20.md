### 3. Compliance Assessment by ISO 9001:2015 Clause

| Clause | Area | Compliance Status | Issues Found |
|--------|------|------------------|--------------|
| 4 | Context of Organization | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | Documentation gaps |
| 5 | Leadership | ‚úÖ Compliant | Agent hierarchy functional |
| 6 | Planning | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | Service planning issues |
| 7 | Support | ‚ùå Non-Compliant | Critical services down |
| 8 | Operation | ‚ùå Non-Compliant | Multiple service failures |
| 9 | Performance Evaluation | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | Monitoring gaps |
| 10 | Improvement | üîÑ In Progress | Audit initiated |

## Root Cause Analysis Requirements

The following areas require immediate Six Sigma DMAIC analysis:

1. **Service Availability Issues**
   - Why are documented services not operational?
   - What caused the service degradation?
   - Why is there a gap between documentation and implementation?

2. **Agent Registry Discrepancies**
   - Why is the actual agent count different from documentation?
   - What prevents agent activation and registration?

3. **Port Configuration Problems**
   - Why are documented ports not accessible?
   - What is the actual vs documented architecture?

## Corrective Action Plan (CAP)

### Immediate Actions (Within 24 hours)
1. **STOP** - Freeze all feature documentation updates until reality matches
2. **ALERT** - Notify all stakeholders of critical service failures
3. **INVESTIGATE** - Launch Six Sigma root cause analysis

### Short-term Actions (Within 7 days)
1. Restore all critical services to operational status
2. Update documentation to reflect actual implementation
3. Implement service health monitoring and alerting
4. Register and activate all documented agents

### Long-term Actions (Within 30 days)
1. Establish documentation control procedures
2. Implement automated compliance checking
3. Create service level agreements (SLAs)
4. Develop preventive maintenance schedules

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas:
1. **Service Reliability** - Multiple critical services offline
2. **Documentation Accuracy** - Significant gaps between documented and actual
3. **System Integration** - Core infrastructure components not functioning

### Risk Mitigation:
1. Implement redundancy for critical services
2. Establish documentation review cycles
3. Create automated testing for all features
4. Develop rollback procedures

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Six Sigma Engagement** - Deploy Six Sigma agent for root cause analysis
2. **Documentation Freeze** - Stop adding new features until existing are verified
3. **Service Recovery Plan** - Prioritize restoration of down services
4. **Compliance Dashboard** - Create real-time ISO 9001 compliance monitoring
5. **Regular Audits** - Schedule monthly compliance audits

## Audit Conclusion

The Rod-Corp Multi-Agent AI Corporate Ecosystem shows **MAJOR NON-CONFORMITIES** with ISO 9001:2015 requirements. The system is **NOT RECOMMENDED** for certification until all major non-conformities are resolved.

### Certification Readiness: ‚ùå NOT READY

### Next Steps:
1. Management review of this audit report
2. Six Sigma root cause analysis initiation
3. Corrective action implementation
4. Follow-up audit in 30 days
