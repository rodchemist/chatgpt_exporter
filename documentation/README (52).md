# Legacy Documentation Reference

This directory preserves historical documents copied from `rod-corp-legacy` for traceability. Each file is listed in `LEGACY_SOURCE_MAP.md` with its migration status.

- Files remain read-only until migrated into controlled structures.
- When a controlled replacement is published, add a superseded notice to the legacy file and update the map.
